//TODO

//Filling Database with API response.- Current Project
- Filled Model with Json Response
- Made data table to hold modal
= working on how to fill database table.

//Goals 
- Data flow starts at wpf populate button >> api get >> Fill data Model Object >> Use data Model Object to fill database table entry.
-- Data is hitting model
-- Data is deserializing
== db connection is bugging out. use try catch to find error details.

// Database notes
- Determine what the best approach to image storage will be. Database or file management. I am leaning towards the File Managements.
- Database Connection String :: Data Source=(localdb)\ProjectModels;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False

//Current Updates.
-Created Database connection
-Connection is throwing exception
-Created Database manager class Called DataBase_Actions 
-Made App.Config file and setup the connection xml. Potental bug in that it does not seem to allow database manager to access it.
