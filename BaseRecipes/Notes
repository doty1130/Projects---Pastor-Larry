//TODO
- research prototype pattern for webpages
- WPF text box needs details filled in to wire it up.
- Add animation to transition into the search page.

//Filling Database with API response.- Current Project
- Filled Model with Json Response
- Made data table to hold modal
= working on how to fill database table.

//Goals 
- Data flow starts at wpf populate button >> api get >> Fill data Model Object >> Use data Model Object to fill database table entry.
-- Data is hitting model
-- Data is deserializing
-- db connection is bugging out. Fixed the bug. 
== DB Commands to fill table are almost built.

// Database notes
- Determine what the best approach to image storage will be. Database or file management. I am leaning towards the File Managements.
- Database Connection String :: Data Source=(localdb)\ProjectModels;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False

//Current Updates.
- Checked the database connection
- Worked out the database nonquery's to make database works
- Built the meal database filling method. Needs to be completed with notes on the file
